## 🎯 Next Steps - Choose Your Path

### Option A: Build APK in Android Studio (Recommended for First-Timers)

**Prerequisites**: Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

```bash
# 1. Open Android Studio project
npm run cap:open:android

# 2. Wait for Gradle sync to complete
# 3. In Android Studio: Build > Generate Signed Bundle / APK
# 4. Select APK > Create keystore > Build
# 5. Find APK in: android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/
```

**📖 Full Guide**: See `ANDROID_APK_BUILD_GUIDE.md`

---

### Option B: Build APK via Command Line (For Experienced Users)

```bash
# Build debug APK (for testing)
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug

# APK Location: android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

---

### Option C: Run on Connected Device (Fastest for Testing)

```bash
# Connect Android device via USB (with USB debugging enabled)
npm run cap:run:android

# This will:
# - Build your web app
# - Sync with Android
# - Install and launch on device
```

## 🔧 Prerequisites Checklist

Before building your first APK:

- [ ] **Android Studio** installed
- [ ] **JDK 17+** installed
- [ ] **Android SDK** installed (API 33+)
- [ ] **Environment variables** set (JAVA_HOME, ANDROID_HOME)
- [ ] **Web app builds** successfully (`npm run build`)

**See**: `ANDROID_APK_BUILD_GUIDE.md` → Prerequisites section

---

## 🌐 Backend Configuration

Your mobile app uses the **same backend** as your web app:

### No Backend Changes Needed! ✨

Your existing Render backend works as-is. Just ensure:

1. **CORS is configured** to accept requests from mobile
2. **API URLs** in your `.env` are correct
3. **Clerk keys** are properly set

```env
# .env file
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com/api
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_or_pk_test_xxxxx
```

**Important**: After changing `.env`:
```bash
npm run build
npx cap sync
# Then rebuild APK
```

---

## 🎨 Customization

### Change App Name
Edit: `android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`

### Change App Icon
Replace icons in: `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-*/`

### Change Splash Screen
Edit: `capacitor.config.json` → plugins → SplashScreen

### Change Package ID
Edit: `capacitor.config.json` → appId
*Note: Changing this requires re-adding Android platform*

---

## 🧪 Testing Your App

### 1. On Physical Device
```bash
# Enable USB debugging on your phone
# Connect via USB
npm run cap:run:android
```

### 2. On Android Emulator
```bash
# Create emulator in Android Studio (Tools > Device Manager)
# Start emulator
npm run cap:run:android
```

### 3. Install APK Manually
```bash
# Copy APK to phone
# Open with file manager
# Tap Install
# (May need to enable "Unknown sources")
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Android Studio not found"
- Install Android Studio
- Set ANDROID_HOME environment variable

### "Gradle sync failed"
- Open Android Studio
- File > Sync Project with Gradle Files
- Check Android SDK is installed

### "White screen on app launch"
- Check browser console in Android Studio Logcat
- Verify API URLs in `.env`
- Ensure build was successful

### "API calls not working"
- Check backend URL
- Verify CORS settings
- Check AndroidManifest.xml has internet permission

**Full Troubleshooting**: See `ANDROID_APK_BUILD_GUIDE.md` → Troubleshooting section

## 🚀 Publishing to Play Store

### High-Level Steps:

1. **Build signed release APK** (with keystore)
2. **Create Play Console account** ($25 one-time fee)
3. **Prepare store listing** (icons, screenshots, description)
4. **Upload APK** to Play Console
5. **Submit for review**
6. **Publish** when approved

**Detailed Guide**: See `ANDROID_APK_BUILD_GUIDE.md` → Publishing section

## 🔐 Security Reminders

- ✅ Keep `.env` file in `.gitignore`
- ✅ Never commit API keys or secrets
- ✅ Use separate keys for dev/production
- ✅ Secure your keystore file (can't be recovered!)
- ✅ Use HTTPS for all API calls

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start with debug APK** - Build release only when ready
2. **Test on real device** - Emulators miss some issues
3. **Keep web and mobile in sync** - Run `npm run cap:sync` after changes
4. **Monitor backend logs** - Watch for mobile-specific issues
5. **Update regularly** - Keep Capacitor and dependencies updated
